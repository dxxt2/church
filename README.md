The Church Project
===================

This project named after Alonzo Church (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church).

This project is developed to track the PRs under each engineer. This is a tedious work to do by using excel,
so I wrote this project. Please see files in the doc folder for more information.

Church is open sourced and MIT licensed.
