The Church Project
===================

This project named after Alonzo Church (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church).

This project is developed to track the PRs under each engineer. This is a tedious work to do by using excel,
so I wrote this project. Please see files in the doc folder for more information.

Church is open sourced and MIT licensed.

## How to Install

I really doubt if this is useful for others. But if you want to install you need to make other projects: kahn, gnats,
jd up and running.

## How to Use

### Engineer

* Login with your alias and default password.
* If you cannot see your issues, send me a email so that I could add your team. Currently I just added two teams.
* You can edit the status of the PR. Your update will be appeared at group PR list and group updates.

* You can navigate to your group report by clicking the menu.
